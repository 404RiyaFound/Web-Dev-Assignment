    <p> In the middle of my biology-driven world, I discovered something unexpected — a love for tech. That moment of
        discovery became a turning point. It gave me clarity about my ability to self-learn, to experiment, and to bring
        scientific ideas to life — all of which, I believe, deeply reflect the spirit of curiosity, initiative, and
        innovation that SST stands for. What drives me to create isn’t just the excitement of building new tech — it’s
        the empathy I’ve gained from personal experiences — especially for the healthcare workers who, despite burnout
        and systemic challenges, devote themselves wholeheartedly to saving lives. I feel like that is the element that
        fuels my desire to build solutions that matter.
