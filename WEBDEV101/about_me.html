                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>
                    Having chosen the <span style="color: blue;">PCMB</span> stream in class 12th, I’ve always been equally captivated by the biological
                    intricacies of life and the logical, problem-solving beauty of mathematics. These dual fascinations
                    have shaped my academic journey and drawn me toward a rare and powerful intersection: where life
                    sciences meet technology.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Even as a non-CS high school graduate with limited technical training, I’ve never let that hold me
                    back. I took the initiative to explore this interdisciplinary space hands-on—most notably by
                    independently designing and building a working model of gel electrophoresis, a fundamental process
                    used in DNA fingerprinting. This wasn’t just a project; it was a transformative experience. It
                    deepened my understanding of molecular biology and awakened me to the immense power of technology in
                    shaping scientific progress.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In the middle of my biology-driven world, I discovered something unexpected — a love for tech. That
                    moment of discovery became a turning point. It gave me clarity about my ability to self-learn, to
                    experiment, and to bring scientific ideas to life — all of which, I believe, deeply reflect the
                    spirit of curiosity, initiative, and innovation that SST stands for. What drives me to create isn’t
                    just the excitement of building new tech — it’s the empathy I’ve gained from personal experiences —
                    especially for the healthcare workers who, despite burnout and systemic challenges, devote
                    themselves wholeheartedly to saving lives. I feel like that is the element that fuels my desire to
                    build solutions that matter.
